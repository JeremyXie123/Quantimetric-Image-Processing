# Quantimetric-Image-Processing
# Purpose
This repository was my attempt at understanding and applying concepts "Quantimetric Image Processing", a theory researched by Dr. Steve Mann, for use in image processing. 

# Notes
- These are the notes I have taken on the Steve Mann's paper, "Comparametric Equations with Practical Applications
in Quantigraphic Image Processing".

- ***My knowledge on the subject is not deep enough to state anything for certain, so I may have understood things wrong. Any advice or pointers would be greatly appreciated. For accurate information, please visit the paper.***
- I was unable to do part 1 of the lab, so there is no code relating to that section in the repository.
- Part 4 may have been done incorrectly, due to a lack of knowledge regarding nti homomorphic imaging.

#Navigation
- The images produced from the different parts can be found under the "Stills" folder.
- The raw video data has been ommitted for memory concerns. They can be accessed from the lab.
- The comparagrams generated in part 2 are located under the "Comparagrams" folder
- The programs are found in the main directory, with comments near the top of the file specifying which part they contribute to.

# Resources
- I strongly suggest reading the paper (http://wearcam.org/comparam.pdf), as it gives insight into the history of earlier cameras, as well as a representation of how a camera works on a fundamental level. 
- The lab which I attempted (http://wearcam.org/ece516/Lab09.htm) is a great way to test comparametric and quantigraphic imaging.
